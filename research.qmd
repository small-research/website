At the **SMaLL** research group, our work lies at the intersection of statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. We are driven by a dual mission: to push the boundaries of AI by developing novel, powerful, and principled methods, and to solve pressing real-world problems across a range of scientific and societal domains.

Our research is grounded in a deep understanding of statistical theory, which allows us to build machine learning models that are not only accurate but also reliable, interpretable, and robust. We focus on three core areas: developing trustworthy AI, advancing core ML methodologies, and applying these innovations to achieve interdisciplinary impact.

### Trustworthy & Reliable AI: Uncertainty, Interpretability, and Calibration

A central theme of our research is moving beyond simple point predictions to create AI systems that understand and communicate their own uncertainty. We believe this is essential for applications in science, medicine, and beyond.

- **Uncertainty Quantification & Conformal Prediction**:  
  We develop cutting-edge techniques for creating statistically valid prediction intervals and confidence sets. Our work, including methods like **CD-split** and **EPICSCore**, provides rigorous, assumption-free uncertainty guarantees via conformal methods, even for complex, high-dimensional data.

- **Interpretability and Explainable AI (XAI)**:  
  We design methods to open the "black box" of complex models like neural networks. Our work on meaningful local explanations (e.g., **MeLIME**, **RFFNet**, and **NLS**) helps users understand why a model makes a particular decision, fostering trust and enabling model debugging.

- **Model Diagnostics and Calibration**:  
  We create tools for rigorously validating and diagnosing machine learning models. This includes techniques for likelihood-free inference (e.g., **WALDO**, **LF2I**) and diagnostics for conditional density models (**LaDaR**), ensuring reliable and well-calibrated probabilistic outputs.

### Core Methodological Advances in Machine Learning

Our foundational work aims to create more flexible, powerful, and efficient learning algorithms.

- **Conditional Density Estimation (CDE)**:  
  A cornerstone of our research is the development of nonparametric methods for estimating full outcome distributions given features. Our **FlexCode** procedure, used by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is one such example applied in astronomy and beyond.

- **Network Science & Graph-based Learning**:  
  We develop methods for community detection, hypothesis testing on graphs, and network modeling, with applications ranging from EEG brain data to social networks.

- **High-Dimensional & Nonparametric Methods**:  
  We specialize in “large \( p \), small \( n \)” problems, using spectral series, wavelets, and kernel methods. We also design efficient algorithms like **ExactBoost** and **BlockBoost** for challenging ML tasks.

- **Modern AI Architectures**:  
  We contribute to model ensembling (**NN-Stacking**), scalable kernel methods (**RFFNet**), and the use of variational autoencoders for high-dimensional hypothesis testing.

### Interdisciplinary Impact: AI in Action

We are passionate about applying our methods to solve concrete problems. Our collaborations span:

- **Astronomy & Cosmology**:  
  Photo-z estimation, galaxy classification, and likelihood-free cosmological inference.

- **Healthcare & Medicine**:  
  Predicting mortality, diagnosing dementia and Parkinson’s (e.g., **Goalkeeper Game**), modeling infectious diseases, and AI tools for breast cancer risk (**PersonalizedUS**).

- **Genetics & Genomics**:  
  QTL mapping, feature selection for ALS studies, and interaction detection in complex traits.

- **Ecology & Environmental Science**:  
  Biodiversity quantification, species composition analysis (**LDAcov**), and population modeling.

- **Law, Social Science & Sports Analytics**:  
  Quantifying legal “loss of a chance”, modeling judicial decisions, and predicting football match outcomes.

- **Materials Science**:  
  Predicting properties of glass materials to guide new compositions, incorporating uncertainty for robust scientific inference.

### Bayesian Foundations and Logical Coherence

Our approach is deeply Bayesian and committed to logical rigor. We believe this foundation leads to better, more coherent statistical and AI models.

- **Foundations of Inference**:  
  We explore statistical decision theory, value of information, and imprecise probability models.

- **Logically-Consistent Hypothesis Testing**:  
  We develop coherent frameworks for multiple hypothesis testing that avoid contradictions. Tools like **REACT** support interpretable and practical alternatives to p-values.
